A total solar eclipse occurred at the Moon's ascending node of the orbit on July 2, 2019 with a magnitude of 1.0459. 
Totality was visible from the southern Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand to the Coquimbo Region in Chile and Central Argentina at sunset, with the maximum of 4 minutes 32 seconds visible from the Pacific Ocean.
Another total solar eclipse will cross this region on December 14, 2020 just 531 days later, but just 355 days later occurs a solar eclipse in the same lunar node as this eclipse, on June 21, 2020.
A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth.
A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. 
Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.
Following the North American solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, Astronomers Without Borders collected eclipse glasses for redistribution to Latin America and Asia for their 2019 eclipses.
Totality travelled over areas with low levels of humidity and light pollution, allowing for very good observations.
There are several major observatories in the regions of South America that experienced totality.
